<h4>Does Fuel Choice Matter? Investigating Fuel	Choice Impact on Vessel Value and Freight Rates</h4>
<p>2025</p>
<p>This project was presented at IAME2024.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	With a rising awareness of climate change and Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
	emissions, there has been a push towards alternative fuels in the maritime
	industry. In this paper, we use linear regression, adaptive lasso regression,
	and XGBoost on a novel dataset of transactions in the freight market and
	second-hand vessel market for gas carriers to investigate the effect of fuel
	choice on vessel value. We find evidence that choosing alternative fuels
	does not affect the vessel's value either positively or negatively, or the
	freight rate the vessel obtain in freight markets.

<h4>The Cost of Weather: Modeling Weather Delay in Bulk Shipping</h4>
<p>2025</p>
<p> Published in the Dept. of Business and Management Science Discussion Paper series</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	Weather is an ever-present factor influencing shipping operations at
	every stage, including port operations. This paper examines the determi-
	nants of weather-induced delays in port operations, the probability and
	duration of such delays, the predictive capability of various statistical
	models, and the potential for improving upon standard industry methods
	for estimating port margins. A wide range of models are investigated,
	including Generalized Linear (GLM) models, Cox Propotional Hazard
	models, and Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) models. The
	findings reveal that a GLM with gamma distributed dependent variables
	provides the best fit for data on delay duration, while a linear multiple
	regression offers the highest predictive accuracy for delay duration. Sim-
	ilarly, probit and logit models are found to perform comparably well for
	both predicting delay probabilities and data fit. Moreover, the analysis
	demonstrates that there are significant potential cost savings when using
	a linear regression model with a probit model to predict delays compared
	to a common industry rule-of-thumb of half a day delay. These results
	underscore the potential for improving operational efficiency and accuracy
	in port margin estimation through statistical modeling techniques

<h4>Ups and downs: Modeling Shipping Freight Rates in a Markov Regime Switching Framework</h4>
<p>2024</p>
<p>A joint paper with Prof. Haiying Jia.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	n this paper, we employ economic theory to examine the supply-
	demand relationship in the freight market to assess the stochastic dynam-
	ics during different marked conditions. We propose the existence of two
	distinct regimes: elastic and inelastic tonnage supply situations. To em-
	pirically investigate these regimes, we apply a Markov regime-switching
	model to estimate a discrete autoregressive regime-switching model using
	freight rate data for Handysize, Panamax, and Capsized dry bulk vessels
	as well as Aframax, Suezmax, and VLCC crude oil tankers, represented
	by the Baltic indexes for these vessel types and sizes. Our findings indi-
	cate that these regimes exhibit differing volatility levels and, in the case of
	tanker vessels, distinct patterns mean reversion. Furthermore, we analyze
	the transition probabilities between regimes, revealing that the current
	shipping rate level is a significant factor in modeling the probability be-
	tween supply regimes.</p>

<h4>Injuries at Sea: A Geo-Spatial Analysis of Marine Accidents</h4>
<p>2023</p>
<p>A joint paper with Prof. Haiying Jia. This project started as coursework in the course ECS530 Analyzing Spatial Data. Presented at the IEEM23 conference in Singapore and published in the conference proceedings.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	Marine safety is of paramount importance.
	Accidents on board a vessel can have a great impact on, or
	even end, the life of a sailor. This is not only a significant
	personal tragedy, but it can also have an impact on the safety
	of the entire crew and the operations of the vessel. In this
	paper, we use data from the Norwegian Maritime Authority
	to investigate the locations of accidents. We observe that
	a significant number of accidents occurred off the coast of
	Western and Northern Norway. We further investigate how
	accidents occur in clusters and conclude that both fatal and
	non-fatal accidents are clustered. Lastly, we investigate the
	optimal locations for search and rescue helicopters to be
	stationed in order to minimize the expected distance between
	accidents and airports. Our results suggest that additional
	helicopters should be stationed in Northern Norway.

<h4>Thiele's Partial Integro-Differential Equation for Jump Diffusions</h4>
<p>2022</p>
<p>My master's thesis. The thesis was supervised by Prof. David Baños at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo during the spring of 2022. The thesis was graded an A.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	Unit-linked policies are often complex life insurance products to price.
	This is due to there being more forms of risk in these policies than in traditional life
	insurance. Unit-linked policies combine investments in financial assets with a
	traditional life insurance policy. In addition to modeling mortality, one also
	needs to model the financial investment.
	The pricing of unit-linked policies can be complicated and difficult to
	calculate. Results like Thiele’s PDE for unit-linked policies have therefore
	been proven for securities models like Black-Scholes, see Aase and
	Persson (1993). In this thesis, we generalize this to contexts where
	the model for the underlying securities is more complex and realistic. We find
	a partial integro-differential equation that models the evolution of value for a
	unit-linked life insurance policy when the underlying security follows a jump
	diffusion model. Jump diffusions are a generalization of diffusion models (like
	Black-Scholes), and allow for better modeling, especially of the tails of
	returns. This means that large losses can be better modeled.
	In addition, we propose some methods for numerically calculating
	prices and use these methods to find the value of some example policies.

<h4>Quantitative Risk Management</h4>
<p>2020</p>
<p>This was a 10 ECT project in the course MAT2000 - Project Work in Mathematics. The paper was supervised by Prof. Frank Proske at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo during the spring of 2020.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	There is a broad societal interest in the stability of financial markets. 
	Individual investors, firms, and regulators all deal with risk and need 
	mathematical ways of quantifying the probability and the consequences 
	of adverse developments in financial markets. The aim of this project is 
	to describe how risk is managed in the financial industry. To do that we 
	are going to define and compare two of the most common risk measures 
	used in the financial industry today, Value-at-Risk (VaRα) and Expected 
	Shortfall (ESα). We show how they are related. Using the concept of a 
	coherent risk measure, we also show why ESα is theoretically preferable 
	to VaRα. In the empirical part of the project, we measure the risk for six 
	portfolios by estimating capital reserve requirements. The portfolios are 
	constructed using real-world securities, the S&P 500, Disney, Boeing, 
	and 1-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Using simulation with stochastic stock 
	prices and stochastic interest rates, we test the reserve capital 
	requirements estimated using the risk measures. Since the COVID-19 
	pandemic and the project coincided, we also got to test the measures of 
	risk during a real-world financial downturn.
