	<h3>Injuries at Sea: A Geo-Spacial Analysis of Marine Accidents</h3>
	<p>2023</p>
	<p>A joint paper with Prof. Haiying Jia. This project started as course work in the course ECS530 Analysing Spacial Data. Presented at the IEEM23 conferance in Singapore and published in the conference precidings. </p>
	<p> <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
	Marine safety is of paramount importance.<br>
	Accidents on board a vessel can have a great impact on, or<br>
	even end, the life of a sailor. This is not only a significant<br>
	personal tragedy, but it can also have an impact on the safety<br>
	of the entire crew and the operations of the vessel. In this<br>
	paper, we use data from the Norwegian Maritime Authority<br>
	to investigate the locations of accidents. We can observe that<br>
	a significant number of accidents occurred off the coast of<br>
	Western and Northern Norway. We further investigate how<br>
	accidents occur in clusters and conclude that both fatal and<br>
	non-fatal accidents are clustered. Lastly, we investigate the<br>
	optimal locations for search and rescue helicopters to be<br>
	stationed in order to minimize the expected distance between<br>
	accidents and airports. Our results suggest that additional<br>
	helicopters should be stationed in Northern Norway.<br>

	<h3>Thiele's partial integro-differential equation for jump diffusions</h3>
	<p>2022</p>
	<p>My master's thesis. The thesis was supervised by Prof. David Baños at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo during the spring of 2022. The thesis was graded to an A. </p>

	<p><b> Abstract:</b> <br> 
	Unit-linked policies are often complex life insurance products to price. This<br>
	is due to there being more forms risk in these policies than in traditional life<br>
	insurance. Unit-liked policies combine investments in financial assets with a<br>
	traditional life insurance policy. In addition to modeling mortality, one also<br>
	needs to model the financial investment.<br>
	The pricing of unit-linked policies can be complicated and difficult to<br>
	calculate. Results like Thiele’s PDE for unit-linked policies have therefore<br>
	been proven for securities models like the Black and Scholes, see Aase and<br>
	Persson 1993. In this thesis, we are going to generalize this to contexts where<br>
	the model for the underlying securities is more complex and realistic. We find<br>
	a partial integro-differential equation that models the evolution of value for a<br>
	unit-linked life insurance policy when the underlying security follows a jump<br>
	diffusion model. Jump diffusions are a generalization of diffusion models (like<br>
	the Black and Scholes), and allow for better modeling, especially the tails of<br>
	the returns. This means that large losses can be better modeled.<br>
	In addition to this we, propose some methods for numerically calculating<br>
	prices and we use these methods to find the value of some example policies<br>

	<h3>Quantitative Risk Management</h3>
	<p>2020</p>
	<p> This was a 10 ECT project in the course MAT2000 - Project Work in Mathematics. The paper was supervised by Prof. Frank Proske at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo during the spring of 2020. </p>

	<p> <b> Abstract:</b> <br> 
	There is a broad societal interest in the stability of financial markets.<br> 
	Individual investors, firms and regulators all deal with risk and need<br> 
	mathematical ways of quantifying the probability and the consequences<br> 
	of adverse development in financial markets. The aim of this project is<br> 
	to describe how risk is managed in the financial industry. To do that we<br> 
	are going to define and compare two of the most common risk measures<br> 
	used in the financial industry today, Value-at-Risk (VaRα) and Expected<br> 
	shortfall (ESα). We show how they are related. Using the concept of a<br> 
	coherent risk measure we also show why ESα is theoretically preferable<br> 
	to VaRα. In the empirical part of the project we measure the risk for 6<br> 
	portfolios by estimating capital reserve requirements. The portfolios are<br> 
	constructed using the real world securities, the S&P500, Disney, Boeing<br> 
	and 1 year U.S. Treasury bonds. Using simulation with stochastic stock<br> 
	prices and stochastic interest rates we are going to test the reserve capital<br> 
	requirement estimated using the risk measures. Since the COVID-19<br> 
	pandemic and the project coincided we also got to test the measures of<br> 
	risk on a real world financial downturn<br>
