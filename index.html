<h4>Does it Pay to be Green? Investigating Alternative Fuel Premium in Vessel Value Using Machine Learning</h4>
<p>Details about this project are not provided yet.</p>
<p>2024</p>
<p>This project was presented at IAME2024 and is meant to be a shorter conferance paper.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	With the dangers of a changing climate starting to become apparent to many the push for lower
	emissions of greenhouse gases has reached the maritime industry. One of the possible actions
	to reduce the emissions from the maritime industry is to move away from traditional fuels like
	heavy oil and marine diesel to alternative fuels with lower emissions like LNG and ammonia.
	This is not unproblematic as these fuels generally are more expensive and demand investments.
	This paper aims to understand how alternative fuels affect the value of vessels. We employ a
	wide array of machine-learning techniques to estimate the effect of vessel fuels on value. Our
	findings suggest that there might be a premium, but if there is then the premium might be small.

<h4>How Much Does Rain Cost? Modeling Weather Delay in Bulk Shipping</h4>
<p>2024</p>
<p>This is planned to be a chapter in my dissertation.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	It is well known that shipping is exposed to weather. Some vessels choose 
	routes based on weather conditions, foggy conditions can affect the risk of accidents, and
	so on. This paper investigates how weather, in particular precipitation,
	can affect the time in port for a vessel. We employ advanced statistical
	tools like Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to model delays in port
	due to weather for port calls at six ports on three continents. We consider
	how climatic conditions like the El-Niño cycle and seasonality affect the
	length of delays for different ports. Moreover, we investigate how much money
	is lost due to delays, and compare an industry standard of expecting half a 
	day delay for a port call to the actual delays encountered. We find that
	assuming half a day can in some ports lead to a relative error of over 150%
	and almost $10,000. Lastly, we propose a model for estimating how much can
	be expected to be lost in USD for a voyage. This is useful for the industry when
	fixing vessels for voyages and in other chartering decisions.

<h4>Ups and Downs</h4>
<p>2024</p>
<p>A joint paper with Prof. Haiying Jia and is planned to be a chapter in my dissertation.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	The shipping industry is famous for its ups and downs. The fortunes of
	shipowners have always been interwoven with the great events of history
	like war and peace. Huge amounts of wealth have been lost and gained in a
	matter of weeks. What are the dynamics in the different regimes? This paper
	aims to study the stochastic properties of the shipping spot rate during
	“good” times and “bad” times in the context of a mean-reverting Ornstein-
	Uhlenbeck process with Markov regime-switching. Firstly, we use economic
	theory to justify why there should be two distinct regimes. Then
	we propose a continuous-time model of the spot freight rates. Thirdly,
	we use a Markov regime-switching model to estimate a discrete version
	of the model. Our results show that the different regimes have different
	levels of volatility, and for tankers, different strengths of mean reversion.
	Lastly, we study the transition probabilities between the regimes in an
	exogenous and an endogenous manner. Here we find that the current level
	of the shipping rate is a significant factor in modeling the probability of
	transitioning between regimes.

<h2>Past Projects</h2>

<h4>Injuries at Sea: A Geo-Spatial Analysis of Marine Accidents</h4>
<p>2023</p>
<p>A joint paper with Prof. Haiying Jia. This project started as coursework in the course ECS530 Analyzing Spatial Data. Presented at the IEEM23 conference in Singapore and published in the conference proceedings.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	Marine safety is of paramount importance.
	Accidents on board a vessel can have a great impact on, or
	even end, the life of a sailor. This is not only a significant
	personal tragedy, but it can also have an impact on the safety
	of the entire crew and the operations of the vessel. In this
	paper, we use data from the Norwegian Maritime Authority
	to investigate the locations of accidents. We observe that
	a significant number of accidents occurred off the coast of
	Western and Northern Norway. We further investigate how
	accidents occur in clusters and conclude that both fatal and
	non-fatal accidents are clustered. Lastly, we investigate the
	optimal locations for search and rescue helicopters to be
	stationed in order to minimize the expected distance between
	accidents and airports. Our results suggest that additional
	helicopters should be stationed in Northern Norway.

<h4>Thiele's Partial Integro-Differential Equation for Jump Diffusions</h4>
<p>2022</p>
<p>My master's thesis. The thesis was supervised by Prof. David Baños at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo during the spring of 2022. The thesis was graded an A.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	Unit-linked policies are often complex life insurance products to price.
	This is due to there being more forms of risk in these policies than in traditional life
	insurance. Unit-linked policies combine investments in financial assets with a
	traditional life insurance policy. In addition to modeling mortality, one also
	needs to model the financial investment.
	The pricing of unit-linked policies can be complicated and difficult to
	calculate. Results like Thiele’s PDE for unit-linked policies have therefore
	been proven for securities models like Black-Scholes, see Aase and
	Persson (1993). In this thesis, we generalize this to contexts where
	the model for the underlying securities is more complex and realistic. We find
	a partial integro-differential equation that models the evolution of value for a
	unit-linked life insurance policy when the underlying security follows a jump
	diffusion model. Jump diffusions are a generalization of diffusion models (like
	Black-Scholes), and allow for better modeling, especially of the tails of
	returns. This means that large losses can be better modeled.
	In addition, we propose some methods for numerically calculating
	prices and use these methods to find the value of some example policies.

<h4>Quantitative Risk Management</h4>
<p>2020</p>
<p>This was a 10 ECT project in the course MAT2000 - Project Work in Mathematics. The paper was supervised by Prof. Frank Proske at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo during the spring of 2020.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
	There is a broad societal interest in the stability of financial markets. 
	Individual investors, firms, and regulators all deal with risk and need 
	mathematical ways of quantifying the probability and the consequences 
	of adverse developments in financial markets. The aim of this project is 
	to describe how risk is managed in the financial industry. To do that we 
	are going to define and compare two of the most common risk measures 
	used in the financial industry today, Value-at-Risk (VaRα) and Expected 
	Shortfall (ESα). We show how they are related. Using the concept of a 
	coherent risk measure, we also show why ESα is theoretically preferable 
	to VaRα. In the empirical part of the project, we measure the risk for six 
	portfolios by estimating capital reserve requirements. The portfolios are 
	constructed using real-world securities, the S&P 500, Disney, Boeing, 
	and 1-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Using simulation with stochastic stock 
	prices and stochastic interest rates, we test the reserve capital 
	requirements estimated using the risk measures. Since the COVID-19 
	pandemic and the project coincided, we also got to test the measures of 
	risk during a real-world financial downturn.
